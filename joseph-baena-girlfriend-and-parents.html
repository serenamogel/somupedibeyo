In an interview with Men’s Health magazine, when he was just 13 years old, he stated,</p><p>I was in the seventh grade, and I can still clearly recall that day. Period five or six. And I’m called to leave the classroom. My mother is there, too, and she says, “We really should go now that everyone is learning about you and your father.” And now, my life is changing right in front of me.</p><p>Conversely, the seven-time Mr. Olympia winner needed seven or eight years to come to terms with the fact that Joseph was his son. Speaking about the subject, Arnold said,</p><p>He started to resemble me, and it seemed like there was something wrong. That’s when I finally understood it. It was never brought up. However, I mean, I assembled the components here. I had the impression that I ought to be the one to look after him and her. I then began looking after Joseph’s financial needs.</p><h2><span id=He_is_the_half-sibling_of_five>He is the half-sibling of five.</span></h2><p>Joseph Baena, the celebrity child, has five half-siblings.

His father was married to his former wife Maria Shriver, while his mother was married to her former husband Rogelio Baena. Since the early 1990s, Mildred had been employed as both Schwarzenegger’s secretary and housekeeper; she is thought to have worked there for more than 20 years.</p><p>Several people claim that Patricia would hop into the bed with Arnold wearing Maria Shriver’s possessions, including jewelry, after she left for work. She became pregnant with Joseph during their liaison, and Maria became pregnant with her second son, Christopher, at the same time.</p><p>After the baby was born, everyone initially believed that he was the son of Mildred and her ex-husband Rogelio. But as time went on, he began to resemble Mr. Olympia from the seven occasions, which alarmed his ex-wife. She confronted her housekeeper and partner, and both of them acquiesced to the accusations, which devastated her.</p><p>In July 2011, Joseph’s father filed for divorce from his stepmother.

They both post a ton of pictures of themselves having fun together online. They enjoy spending a lot of time together and pretty much do everything together, including going to restaurants, working out, and riding. But this wasn’t how things started out.</p><p>Raised by his mother, he was anxious and worried that his father would think poorly of him. In an interview with Unwaxed, the rising star discussed his connection in detail, saying,</p><p>It took some time for us to become quite close and for me to feel comfortable joking about and discussing everything.</p><p>At this point, Joseph claimed he and his father joke about everything, and the two are as close as they can be. In addition, Arnold has wished Joseph a happy birthday and said, “Happy birthday, Joseph,” demonstrating his devotion for him. Excellent athlete as well as a scholar. I adore and am proud of you!</p><h2><span id=A_Brief_Overview_Of_His_Father_An_Actor>A Brief Overview Of His Father: An Actor</span></h2><p>On July 30, 1947, Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born to Gustav and Aurelia Schwarzenegger.
