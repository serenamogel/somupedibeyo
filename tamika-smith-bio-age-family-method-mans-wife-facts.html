Smith Jr., who goes by the stage name Method Man.&nbsp;The couple, who got engaged in 1999, were so bonded that they tied the wedding knot two years later, in 2001 to be exact.</span></p><p><span>As much as she can, she tries to keep her personal life out of the public eye to avoid unnecessary distractions that could ruin her union.&nbsp;The socialite wife once served as her husband’s PA before taking marriage vows in 2001.&nbsp;We are going to take a look at Method Man’s Wife’s Biography, Age, Family and Surrounding Facts in this piece.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tamika Smith’s Bio and Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tamika Smith is an American citizen, however, there is little information about her date and place of birth.&nbsp;However, available information indicates that Tamika Smith was only eighteen when her sister’s son, Dontae Hawkins, was shot to death in April 1994 at the tender age of two.&nbsp;So it’s safe to say that she was born in 1975.</span></p><p><span>However, the beautiful woman has not spoken about her early life, family background or educational activities.&nbsp;However, we learned from her LinkedIn account that she attended College of Staten Island, where she majored in Entrepreneur and Small Business Operations.&nbsp;The same page lists Richmond County Real Estate Institute as the alma mater from which she earned her associates degree in business management/administration.</span></p><p><span>Regarding Tamika Smith’s employment record, from 1997 to 2002, she was the personal assistant to her now-husband Clifford, known as Method Man.&nbsp;She then worked as a caretaker and development worker for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities responsibilities between 2007 and 2008.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tamika Smith’s family</span></strong></h2><p><span>If there’s anything virtually everyone wants to know about the mysterious Tamika Smith, it would be details of her parents and immediate family.&nbsp;A very quiet and reserved person, Tamika has kept her parents’ identities a secret.&nbsp;Despite this, she is related to Justin Hawkins, a woman associated with Wu-Tang whose son was shot dead in 1994 at the tender age of two.</span></p><p><span>Legendary hip-hop Grammy Award-winning musician Method Man is the wonderful husband of Tamika Smith.&nbsp;They got engaged in 1999 and tied the wedding knot in 2001.&nbsp;They have three children: two sons, Sha Smith and Raekwon Smith, and a daughter named Cheyenne Smith, both born in 1997.&nbsp;The children have all grown up.&nbsp;The family has lived happily in Staten Island, New York.</span></p><p><span>Method Man was born in Hempstead, Long Island, New York as Clifford Smith on March 2, 1971. He, like several other celebrities, came from a broken home.&nbsp;As a result, young Clifford commuted from his father’s place on Long Island to his mother’s home in the Park Hill section of Staten Island.</span></p><p><span>Despite his back and forth background and growing days, he made something out of life.&nbsp;He is probably one of the most awarded musicians, having worked with top acts like Alicia Keys and recorded six studio albums, four collaboration albums with over fifty films and TV series.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Facts about the method man’s wife</span></strong></h2><h4><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h4><p><span>The businesswoman and mother of three hasn’t disclosed her net worth like almost everything else about her.&nbsp;We know that she worked as her husband’s PA for five years, Method Man, and two years as a caretaker for people with disabilities.&nbsp;Interestingly, she is married to a millionaire whose worth is $14 million.</span></p><h4><strong><span>She battled cancer in 2006</span></strong></h4><p><span>Tamika Smith battled cancer around 2006.&nbsp;The family kept it top secret until Wendy Williams, a talk show host, revealed it.&nbsp;The exhibition did not sit well with the family and eventually led to Method Man’s departure from social media.</span></p><h4><strong><span>hobbies</span></strong></h4><p><span>Clifford’s beloved wife, according to her LinkedIn page, loves to exercise, eat well and have a laugh with friends.&nbsp;No wonder she has retained her slim structure.&nbsp;More so, she said she loves meeting new people and making new connections.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiskaK2rK2MrKSirJhir6q7jJqenmWWlrqquNhmpJ6smKSxbrnAp6pmr5mbsm6ywJyrrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftamika-smith-bio-age-family-method-mans-wife-facts.html&text=Tamika%20Smith%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Method%20Mans%20Wife%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftamika-smith-bio-age-family-method-mans-wife-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftamika-smith-bio-age-family-method-mans-wife-facts.html&title=Tamika%20Smith%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Method%20Mans%20Wife%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftamika-smith-bio-age-family-method-mans-wife-facts.html&title=Tamika%20Smith%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Method%20Mans%20Wife%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftamika-smith-bio-age-family-method-mans-wife-facts.html&title=Tamika%20Smith%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Method%20Mans%20Wife%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftamika-smith-bio-age-family-method-mans-wife-facts.html&description=Tamika%20Smith%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Method%20Mans%20Wife%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-sylvester-stallones-daughters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who are Sylvester Stallones daughters?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-alaska-daily-getting-a-second-season-or-is-it-canceled.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Alaska Daily getting a second season or is it canceled?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
