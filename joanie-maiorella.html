Her sister, Deena, came to recognition with her appearance on the MTV reality show <i>Jersey Shore.</i></p><p>Joanie became an internet personality and came to the <strong>spotlight </strong>after she appeared in a number of episodes in season 5 of the show <i>Jersey Shore</i> along with her sister, Deena<i>.</i> Since not much of her was shown in the show, people are interested in her. So, here is everything we know about the celebrity sister.</p><h2>Net Worth: How Rich Is Joanie?</h2><p>Being the sister of a famous star, Joanie Maiorella is commendable for maintaining her <strong>privacy </strong>since she hasn't revealed any personal information about her life. So everything like her profession, income, and net worth remain under the covers. So, let's know the<strong> net worth</strong> of her sister, Deena Nicole, instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/Us%20weekly%20(1)-1672216945069.jpg><p>The net worth of Deena Nicole is estimated to be around <strong>$2 million</strong>. She is a television star who has starred in <i>Jersey Shore </i>and <i>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.</i> Moreover, she owns an online baby clothing store with various adorable and fun baby products.</p><h2>Educational Qualifications&nbsp;</h2><p>Unfortunately, there has been no information about the education of Joanie Maiorella. On the other hand, her sister, Deena, went to the <strong>New Egypt High School</strong>. Since Deena liked to dance, she participated in dance in her high school and became a member of their high school's cheerleading squad.</p><p>And for her undergraduate studies, she got enrolled in Brookdale Community College. However, it is reported that she dropped out of college before graduation.</p><h2>Parents: Her Father Died From Leukemia</h2><p>Joanie was born in Plumsted Township, New Jersey. And her parents are<strong> John Cortese</strong> and <strong>Joan Cortese</strong>.&nbsp;However, she lost her dad, John, to <strong>Leukemia </strong>in 2016. And there has been no news about her mother. Nonetheless, both of her parents were Italian-American.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/27/13397568_1180634761970011_330369644_n%20(1)-1672137246295.jpg><h2>Relationship Status: Does Joanie Have A Husband?</h2><p>As of now, Joanie Maiorella has already become a married woman. Since her maiden name is Cortese, she took her husband's last name, "Maiorella," after <strong>marriage</strong>. However, she hasn't disclosed anything related to her marital life.&nbsp;</p><p>This was expected of her since she disappeared after making a few appearances during the show. And Joanie's sister, Deena being respectful of her decisions, has also refrained from spilling the tea about her sister's life.</p><h2>More About Deena: Joanie's Sister</h2><p>Joanie's sister, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Deena Nicole Cortese</a>, or Deena Buckner, is an American reality TV actress best known as the cast of the show <i>Jersey Coast.</i> Apart from <i>Jersey Shore, </i>she has also appeared on other reality shows like <i>Couple Therapy (2014) </i>and <i>Celebrity Family Feud (2020).</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/310546760_782145076384517_1356870120495525796_n%20(1)-1672216506511.jpg><p>Deena initially auditioned for the show in its first season as its cast member. However, she was rejected from the show. Later she was brought in as a replacement for Angelina Pivarnick after she left the show. Moreover, she was <strong>recommended </strong>by another member of the show, Snooki, her friend who did their first audition together. Then she joined for the third season in 2010 until 2012.</p><p>Regarding Joanie's sister Deena's marital status, she is happily married to her <strong>six-year-long</strong> boyfriend, Christopher Buckner. She got <strong>engaged </strong>in November 2016 and got married on October 28, 2017. She is also the mother of two children.</p><h2>Her Sister Got Arrested For Disorderly Conduct</h2><p>Back in 2012, during the show, <i>Jersey Shore's</i> sixth season, Joanie's sister, Deena, the show's star, got arrested for public intoxication and disorderly. She was day drinking in the Seaside Heights. And hence, she was walking through the streets in her drunken daze and dancing and doing all the weird stuff that drunk people do.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>At first, the cops holding her down were patient enough to tolerate her for a few minutes. However, then Deena did not look like she would stop any minute, so they tied, cuffed her down, put her in the back seat of the<strong> cop car</strong>, and took her to the police station.</p><p>In the end, Deena had to get picked up by her <strong>parents</strong>. Even by the time, her parents picked her up, she still seemed drunk and out of her mind.</p><h2>Joanie's Sister Deena's Touching Action Towards Her Melted Her Fans</h2><p>After Joanie's father's death, her sister, Deena, who was getting married a year later in <strong>2017</strong>, made an emotional post about her father. Moreover, she also took a piece of her dad's clothing and sewed it into the chest part of her dress.&nbsp;</p><p>This moved her fans to tears, and she became more loved among the viewers. Along with that, she also wrote:</p><p><i>“Even though you won’t be with me tomorrow physically .. I’ll have a piece of you with me, and close to my heart while I’m walking down the aisle. I love and miss you, daddy #justacoupleofbucks #dadsshirt #missyou .. I cut a piece of his shirt and sewed it to my dress next to my heart.”</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/instaaaaa%20(2)-1672212207782.jpg><h2>Social Media Handles</h2><p>Though Joanie looks like someone who wouldn't use social media, she is indeed active on them. She is available on Instagram under the username <a href=# rel=nofollow>@joaniem7714</a>. She has over <strong>2k</strong> followers, which is pretty good for an everyday person.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she has kept her account private. It seems she created the account to connect to her family and loved ones. Moreover, she seems to not be available on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Joanie Is A Reiki Master & Science Teacher</h2><p>According to Joanie's Instagram profile, she is a <strong>Reiki Master</strong>. Though we couldn't take a closer look at her profile since she kept it private, she has kept several key things to her in her Instagram bio.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, to our surprise, she is also a <strong>science teacher</strong> and a Lyme warrior. The public believed that she was likely to be a businesswoman. Since she was a famous celebrity sister & made her appearance in the reality show along with her sister, no one thought that she could be a teacher and science teacher on top of that.&nbsp;</p><h2>Summary Points To Remember About Joanie Maiorella</h2><ul><li>Joanie is the older sister of the <i>Jersey Shore </i>star, Deena Nicole Cortese, and also made her appearances in the show.</li><li>The celebrity sister Joanie&nbsp;is from a Christian household and is a religious person who believes in god.</li><li>She is an Italian-American who was born to parents John Cortese and Joan Cortese.
