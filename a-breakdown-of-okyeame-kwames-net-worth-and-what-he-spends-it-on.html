Popularly known as Rap Doctor, he has perfectly blended his music, business, and other philanthropist activities which have earned him numerous awards within and outside the shores of Ghana and Africa. So far, Kwame’s efforts have paid off big time. With a net worth reading in the millions, it is no surprise that he comes out among the top wealthiest artists in his country.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-over-7-million-net-worth-comes-from-music-and-business-earnings></span> <strong>His </strong><strong>over $7 Million </strong><strong>Net Worth comes from Music and Business Earnings</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of this writing, Okyeame Kwame’s net worth is estimated to be about $7 million and this qualifies him as one of the richest music artists in Ghana. His Financial status came as no surprise to his fans for several reasons. For one, Kwame is a skilled rapper whose music has unified Ghanaians all over the world.</p><p>Second, Kwame’s marketing prowess is still a subject of wonder to many professional marketers in Ghana. Through innovative marketing methods, Kwame has pushed his music into entertainment gadgets, party halls, homes, and hearts of millions of Ghanaians today.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=okyeame-owns-one-mic-entertainment></span><strong>Okyeame owns One Mic Entertainment</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While it is still unclear how much he earns from his music, we know that music is not the only thread that makes up his entire net worth. Asides from earning good money from his music, Kwame also runs a variety of enterprises. Here are the few we know about. As of this writing, he is the sole owner of the record label One Mic Entertainment. Today, One Mic Entertainment has become an effective launching pad for many young and upcoming music artists in Ghana.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-is-a-partner-of-horseman-shoes></span><strong>He is a Partner of Horseman Shoes</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Asides from One Mic Entertainment, Kwame also co-founded Firm Bridges Communications. It is not clear how much stake he owns in the company or how that determines his share of the profits. What’s no secret is that he features on the founders’ list. Kwame also partners with the successful Accra-based footwear brand, Horseman Shoes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=endorsement-deals-with-mtn-group-coca-cola-and-gt-bank></span><strong>Endorsement Deals with MTN Group, Coca-Cola, and GT Bank</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kwame’s incredible musical career has attracted several brands and organizations; bringing him into a variety of endorsement deals and juicy contracts. So far, we know that he has ongoing brand ambassadorship contracts with the likes of MTN Group, Coca-Cola, and GT Bank.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=much-of-his-money-goes-into-family-fashion-and-philanthropy></span><strong>Much of His Money goes into Family, Fashion, and Philanthropy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-invests-in-african-prints></span><strong>He Invests in African Prints</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Okyeame Kwame is famous for his impeccable fashion taste. Why else can millions of fans spot him out in jiffy? He invests in bespoke wears made with African textiles with special Ghanian designs. This has become his signatory wear over the years. Little wonder in 2016, he won the Male Celebrity Fashion Icon of the Year at the Ghana Fashion Awards.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kwame-has-a-thing-for-flashy-rides></span><strong>Kwame has a Thing for Flashy Rides</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>All over the world, celebrities are known for their individual fascinations with planes, motorcycles, wristwatches, and of course, cars. Okyeame Kwame is not an exception. As we show you details about where his money goes, we must also mention the toys parked in his garage.</p><p>Kwame shocked his fans when he revealed the line up of cars. For all we know, the super-skilled rapper has a thing for flashy rides. He recently flashed his newly acquired Land Rover Discovery before fans. The Land Rover Discovery 2020 comes with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and blind spot monitoring. According to&nbsp;USNews, the base model starts at $52,300.</p><p>But cars are not the only toys in Kwame’s garage. The rapper also uses a Kawasaki D-Tracker motorbike. Sure enough, there were controversies over the identity of the man in the picture. Some argued that it was not Kwame. But He has since cleared the air saying that it was actually him.</p><p>While some might see it as a luxury ride, Kwame admits that going on two tires is a matter of necessity. Because of the traffic holdup in parts of Accra, especially in the mornings and evenings, he uses his motorbike on occasions.</p><p>So far we have reasons to believe that Kwame has several other exotic cars in his fleet; from Jaguar, Rolls Royce to Ferrari. More recently he also gave fans a peek into his lavish mansion.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-is-big-in-the-fight-against-hepatitis-b></span><strong>He is Big in the Fight Against Hepatitis B</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Another major pipeline Kwame sends most of his money is philanthropy. In 2009, he founded the Okyeame Kwame Foundation to raise public awareness on Hepatitis B. The foundation also provides screening, prevention, and sensitization to mitigate Hepatitis B in Ghana. Partnering with MDS-Lancet Laboratories and MTN Ghana has made this initiative super successful. Together, the Okyeame Kwame Foundation holds screening and vaccination campaigns across Ghana.</p><p>As the brilliant marketer that he is, Kwame once organized what he called the Celebrity Car Wash. The event is a rich mix of games, sports, and snapshots with celebrities in East Legon. The goal? Raise funds to provide free vaccination for over 1000 Ghana citizens.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-is-now-hepatitis-b-ambassador-for-the-ghana-health-service></span><strong>He is now Hepatitis B Ambassador for the Ghana Health Service</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Due to his restless actions and events organized to fund free screening for under-served Ghanaians, Kwame was appointed Hepatitis B Ambassador for the Ghana Health Service.</p><p>In 2017, the rap artist cum philanthropist received a United States Presidential Volunteer Service Award. The award originally reserved for US citizens was conferred on Kwame in recognition of his selfless contribution towards treating and preventing hepatitis B.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=an-overview-of-the-rap-doctors-music-career></span><strong>An Overview of the Rap Doctor’s Music Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Indeed, Okyeame Kwame is one of the most successful Ghanian musicians of this age and perhaps will be for a long time to come. To get to where he’s now, the musician began honing his skills from wayback in time.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-began-singing-from-his-high-school-days></span><strong>He Began Singing from His High School Days</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It began in the early 1990s. The then-teenage rapper kicked off what would become an enviable music career from his high school days. Back then, Kwame rapped and sang at various events and shows but never really gained recognition until 1997. That year, he’d joined the Akyeame hip life duo alongside Akyeame Kofi (real name, Daniel Kofi Amoateng).</p><p>In the years that followed, the duo took the Ghanaian music space by storm; recording several albums such as Nyansapo (1997), Nkonsonkonson (1998), Ntoaso (2000), and Apam Oforo (2002). After 7 years together, however, they went their separate ways in 2004. Kwame went on to perform solo under his record label One Mic Entertainment.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-won-his-first-award-in-2009></span><strong>He won His First Award in 2009</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>5 years after going solo, he was awarded Artist of the Year in the Ghana Music Awards (2009). The award sparked Kwame’s confidence so much that he dropped another album in which he dubbed himself as BRA ( Best Rapper Alive).</p><p>Of course, this did not go down well with other prominent rappers at the time. While others murmured their displeasure, a few such as the Ghanaian renowned rap artist, Obrafour, called Kwame out. This became one of the many career tussles typical among music artists. But Kwame seemed right after all. Time proved it!</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=okyeame-kwame-now-has-international-awards-and-recognitions></span><strong>Okyeame Kwame now has International Awards and Recognitions</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2016, John Cranley, the then Mayor of the city of Cincinnati, USA presented Okyeame Kwame with a Key to the City. The Mayor also pronounced every 17 November as “Okyeame Kwame Day”.</p><p>The following year Kwame received the award for the best video honor (for his song Small Small) at the 2017 Ghana Music Honours. What’s more? Kwame was awarded the United States Presidential Volunteer Service Award. Although the award only features Americans, the US government made an exception for Kwame who got the Kingdom Humanitarian Award.</p><p>Late that year, Kwame stood alongside football legend David Beckham and acting superstar Hugh Jackman to become UNICEF Super Dad Ambassadors. In 2020, his work, Bolgatanga, won the Record of the Year at the Vodafone Ghana Music Awards.</p><p>So far, his music has contributed immensely to Ghanaian liberal culture. His lyrics are known to be laced with wisdom, didactic themes, and social consciousness. Some of his songs are currently studied in Ghanaian Universities today.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kwame-is-a-husband-and-doting-father-of-two></span><strong>Kwame is a Husband and Doting Father of Two</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since 2009, Kwame has been married to Annica Nsiah-Apau. Their relationship has been a goal for millions of fans who look up to the couple. Annica has been a huge support to his career from the very start. In 2015, Kwame told Showbiz that he has never cheated on his wife with another woman. They are blessed with two wonderful children, Sir Kwame Bota and Sante Antwiwaa. Kwame Okyeame splurges on his family in no small way. From family vacations to casual outings, the music artist and businessman hold nothing back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJldl7%2BmrcqdprCmXaSzbrvKspyapZViuLitzJ6qZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2aZnpl6uLTArWShnV2ovaa6w6xkoqxdpLtw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-breakdown-of-okyeame-kwames-net-worth-and-what-he-spends-it-on.html&text=A%20Breakdown%20of%20Okyeame%20Kwames%20Net%20Worth%20and%20What%20He%20Spends%20it%20On&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-breakdown-of-okyeame-kwames-net-worth-and-what-he-spends-it-on.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-breakdown-of-okyeame-kwames-net-worth-and-what-he-spends-it-on.html&title=A%20Breakdown%20of%20Okyeame%20Kwames%20Net%20Worth%20and%20What%20He%20Spends%20it%20On" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-breakdown-of-okyeame-kwames-net-worth-and-what-he-spends-it-on.html&title=A%20Breakdown%20of%20Okyeame%20Kwames%20Net%20Worth%20and%20What%20He%20Spends%20it%20On" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-breakdown-of-okyeame-kwames-net-worth-and-what-he-spends-it-on.html&title=A%20Breakdown%20of%20Okyeame%20Kwames%20Net%20Worth%20and%20What%20He%20Spends%20it%20On" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-breakdown-of-okyeame-kwames-net-worth-and-what-he-spends-it-on.html&description=A%20Breakdown%20of%20Okyeame%20Kwames%20Net%20Worth%20and%20What%20He%20Spends%20it%20On" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cinema-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cinema Lyrics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./somehow-zootopia-erotica-appears-in-netflixs-resident-evil.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Somehow, Zootopia erotica appears in Netflixs Resident Evil">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
