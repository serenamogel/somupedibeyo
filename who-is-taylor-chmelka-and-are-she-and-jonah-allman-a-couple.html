Rather than exploring relationships with any of the other men, Taylor and Jonah instantly hit it off, continuing to build a connection with one another during Casa Amor week, as well as after the re-coupling — it was truly love at first sight!</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>After getting to know each other for several days, Taylor and Jonah eventually agreed to be an exclusive couple, however, the hot new bombshell was forced to leave the villa far too soon…</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>In a shocking elimination, host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Hyland</a> read off the islanders who were the least favorable among viewers of Love Island: USA, based on the results of an online poll. Sending two boys and two girls home that fateful night, Taylor and Hannah Ortega were the two women dumped from the villa, likely due to their lack of screen time during the days that followed the re-coupling.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Lucky for Taylor, Jonah was not willing to leave her behind. The California native delivered an extremely heartfelt speech to his fellow islanders, prior to self-eliminating and leaving the villa alongside his new girlfriend.</p><p>“So people have been asking me questions about how I feel about Taylor C. I told the guys before I came out here… I said that I’ve had a great experience. I came in expecting nothing [but] open to everything. If I had had a box of checklists, I would’ve checked them all, and it ended with her. I feel like I’ve made such a great, genuine connection with her that was so deep, and for me, I don’t want to continue this experience if it’s not with her. I feel like I’ve completed my Love Island experience.”</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>While viewers have gotten to know Taylor and Jonah’s relationship throughout Love Island: USA, who is Taylor beyond the villa?
