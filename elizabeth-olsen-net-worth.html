She has earned her popularity and net worth paving her way in the entertainment industry, showing her acting skills in such films as “The Avengers: Age Of Ultron” (2015), “Martha Marcy May Marlene” (2011), for which she was awarded the Best Actress among other recognitions and “Godzilla” (2014) among others. She has been an active member of the entertainment industry since 1993.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Elizabeth Olsen is? According to sources, it is estimated that Elizabeth Olsen`s overall net worth is $5 million, an amount accumulated through her career as an actress now spanning more than 20 years.</p><h3>Elizabeth Olsen Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Elisabeth was born into a family of four siblings, of whom elder twin sisters <a href=#>Mary-Kate</a> and <a href=#>Ashley</a> are also involved in acting. Regarding her education, Elizabeth attended the Campbell Hall High School from pre-school to the 12th grade, following which she enrolled in Tisch School of the Arts, and in order to expand her knowledge and skills, Elizabeth spent a semester in Moscow, studying at the Moscow Art Theatre, through the MATS program of the Eugene O’Neil Theater Center.</p><p>Elisabeth`s acting career began as early as the age of four, when she was featured in a number of the productions by her older sisters <a href=#>Mary-Kate</a> and <a href=#>Ashley</a>, including the “Our First Video” (1993) and “How the West Was Fun” (1994) among others. However she made a breakthrough on her own in 2011, earning a main role in the film “Martha Marcy May Marlene”, which role earned her numerous prestigious critiques and awards, launching her further into the world of acting and increasing her net worth. In the same year she acquired another main role, in the horror film “Silent House”, portraying Sarah, a girl haunted by supernatural forces as she is trapped in her family`s lakeside home. Her net worth increased in 2013, when she appeared in the films “Very Good Girls”, alongside <a href=#>Dakota Fanning</a> in main roles, and in the drama film “Kill Your Darlings”.</p><p>In 2014 Elizabeth had a small role in the film “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” as Wanda Maximoff, which eventually earned her an appearance in the blockbuster film “Avengers: The Age Of Ultron”, (2015) again as Wanda Maximoff, but in addition to her role she used her telekinetic powers as Scarlet Witch</p><p>Her latest ventures in the entertainment industry that have benefited her net worth includes her appearance in the film “I Saw The Light”, the biography film of <a href=#>Hank Williams</a>, in which Elizabeth is cast as his wife, Audrey Mae Williams. Furthermore, she is also in the main cast of the next Captain America franchise film “Captain America’s Civil War” which is scheduled for a release in 2016.</p><p>Overall, Elizabeth`s career is rather successful, as having started on her own in 2011, she has already appeared in 15 film titles and earned numerous awards, so her career will undoubtedly expand in the coming years, and with these new ventures her net worth will increase.</p><p>When it comes to her personal life, Elizabeth was in a romantic relationship with the actor and fashion model Boyd Holbrook from September 2012; the couple became engaged in March 2014, however they broke up in January 2015.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=29.156053184045><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Elizabeth Olsen</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 16, 1989</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Singer</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>Campbell Hall High School, Tisch School of the Arts, Moscow Art Theatre, Eugene O'Neill Theater Center</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>David Olsen, Jarnett Olsen</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Mary-Kate Olsen, Ashley Olsen, Trent Olsen, Taylor Olsen, Jake Olsen</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nicknames</td><td>Lizzie Olsen , Elizabeth Chase Olsen , Lizzie , Liz , Elizabeth Marie Olsen , Elizabeth Chase "Lizzie" Olsen</td></tr><tr readability=0.28571428571429><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/OfficiallyElizabethOlsen</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0647634</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26666666666667><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/elizabeth-olsen-mn0002750395</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>BAFTA Rising Star Award (2013), Fangoria Chainsaw Awards - Best Leading Actress (2013), Hollywood Rising Star Award - Deauville American Film Festival (2015)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nominations</td><td>Saturn Awards, Satellite Awards, Gotham Independent Film Awards, Teen Choice Awards, Broadcast Film Critics Association, Toronto Film Critics Association, Chicago Film Critics Association Awards</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>Movies</td><td>“Avengers: Infinity War” (2018), “Our First Video” (1993), “How the West Was Fun” (1994), “The Avengers: Age Of Ultron” (2015), “I Saw the Light” (2015), “Martha Marcy May Marlene” (2011), “Very Good Girls”, “Kill Your Darlings” (2013), “Godzilla” (2014), “Capta...</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>“The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley” (1994-1997)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Clear green eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Warm brown hair.</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=80.029663434113><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>It just felt playful, like you're playing make-believe.
