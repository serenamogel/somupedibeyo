the killer $10,000 for research and surveillance of Martin to plan the hit, said Mr Whalley, including visiting the target’s home and flying a drone over the property.</p><p

the lethal plan.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ex-soldier was part of soldier of fortune outfit Shadows of Hope, which calls itself ‘the world’s most dangerous and fearless charity’.</p><p
