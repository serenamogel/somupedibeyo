In 1969, Polanski's pregnant wife, actress <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/sharon-tate data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sharon Tate" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sharon Tate</a>, was brutally murdered by members of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/charles-manson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Manson's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Manson's</a> cult, and in 1977, Polanski was indicted on six criminal counts for having sexual relations with a minor.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life in Europe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Raimund Polanski was born on August 18, 1933, in Paris, France. At the age of three, he moved with his family to his father's native city of Krakow, Poland. In 1941, his parents were imprisoned in various Nazi concentration camps, leading to his mother's death in Auschwitz. In order to escape deportation, Polanski lived with several different Polish families until he was reunited with his father in 1944.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Films</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a teenager, Polanski developed his acting skills in radio dramas and films. In 1954, he enrolled at the Polish National Film Academy in Lodz, where his body of work consisted of short films and documentaries. Upon his graduation, he appeared in a number of movies, including famed Polish director Andrzej Wajda's Lotna (1959), Innocent Sorcerers (1960) and Samson (1961).</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Knife in the Water,' 'Repulsion'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1962, he directed his first feature-length film, Knife in the Water. The international recognition that followed, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film, gave Polanski the chance to bring his movies to a more mainstream audience. The following year, he moved to London, where his next offering, the psychological thriller Repulsion (1965), was considered equally compelling by critics and audiences.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Rosemary's Baby'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1968, Polanski moved to Hollywood, making his American film debut with the classic thriller Rosemary's Baby, which featured exceptional performances by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/mia-farrow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mia Farrow" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mia Farrow</a> and John Cassavetes.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wife Sharon Tate's Murder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite his burgeoning film career, Polanski endured a devastating tragedy in 1969 when his pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, was<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/sharon-tate-murder-charles-manson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" brutally murdered" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> brutally murdered</a> by members of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/manson-family-members data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Manson "Family."' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Manson "Family."</a> The extreme violence experienced by Polanski throughout his life was often reflected in his films, which tended to focus on the darker themes of alienation and evil — most notably, in the modern film noir Chinatown (1974), featuring John Huston, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jack-nicholson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack Nicholson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jack Nicholson</a> and Faye Dunaway.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sexual Abuse Case</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977, Polanski was indicted on six criminal counts for having sexual relations with a minor. The alleged act took place with a 13-year-old girl, in the home of Jack Nicholson. Both Nicholson and his longtime girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, testified against Polanski when the highly publicized case was brought to trial. Polanski pleaded guilty to one charge of unlawful sexual intercourse and underwent six weeks of psychiatric evaluation at a state prison in California. Although additional criminal charges were still pending, Polanski fled the United States after his discharge. While authorities were not actively seeking him out, he continued to face the possibility of prison if he returned to America.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Return to Filmmaking</h2><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Tess'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Polanski traveled to Europe and eventually settled in Paris, where he directed the critically acclaimed Tess (1979) — an adaptation of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/writer/thomas-hardy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thomas Hardy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Thomas Hardy</a>'s novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Throughout the 1980s, he concentrated on stage acting, appearing in productions of Amadeus (1981) and Metamorphosis (1988).</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Death and the Maiden'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Polanski returned to film work with the intense thriller Frantic (1988), starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/harrison-ford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harrison Ford" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harrison Ford</a> and Betty Buckley, followed by the erotic drama Bitter Moon (1992), with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/hugh-grant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hugh Grant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hugh Grant</a> and Polanski's current wife Emmanuelle Seigner. Both projects failed to impress critics, but Polanski reestablished himself in 1994 with Death and the Maiden, a film adaptation of Ariel Dorfman's play. In 1999, Polanski directed the supernatural thriller The Ninth Gate, which starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/johnny-depp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnny Depp" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Johnny Depp</a>. The film's critical and commercial reception was tepid.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Oscar Win for 'The Pianist'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Polanski staged a comeback in 2002 with the critically acclaimed Holocaust drama The Pianist, which won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Polanski won a surprise Best Director Oscar for the film, but was not allowed to attend the award ceremony due to his criminal indictment. The film's star, 29-year-old Adrien Brody, also earned an Oscar for his performance.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Oliver Twist'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following The Pianist, Polanski said he was anxious to make a film his children could enjoy. His next project was a film adaptation of the classic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/charles-dickens data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Dickens" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Dickens</a> novel Oliver Twist (2005), starring Ben Kingsley. Despite a strong cast, the film performed poorly at the box office and received tepid reviews from critics.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Ghost Writer,' 'Venus in Fur'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 2010 release of The Ghost Writer, a political thriller starring Pierce Brosnan and Ewan McGregor, marked the start of a prolific decade for the director. He followed with the dark comedy Carnage (2011); the erotic Venus in Fur (2013); and the psychological thriller Based on a True Story, the latter two starring Polanski's wife, Emmanuelle Seigner.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Legal Problems and Sexual Abuse Fallout</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2009, Polanski was on his way to picking up a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich film festival when he was arrested by Swiss police on the longstanding warrant for his sexual activity with the 13-year-old girl in 1977. After a legal battle about his extradition, the Swiss ultimately denied the U.S. request. Polanski later received his award with the premiere of the documentary Roman Polanski: A Film Memoir at the festival in 2011.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Another U.S. extradition request in 2015, this time in Poland, was also rejected.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled the director due to their new ethical standards based on the #MeToo movement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Polanski did not attend France's César Film Awards ceremony in February 2020, he became the story of the night when an actresses and two others walked out to protest his best director and best adapted screenplay wins for the film An Officer and a Spy.</p><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Roman Polanski</li><li>Birth Year: 1933</li><li>Birth date: August 18, 1933</li><li>Birth City: Paris</li><li>Birth Country: France</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Director Roman Polanski is known for his films, the charges against him of statutory rape and for his wife's murder by followers of Charles Manson.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Drama</li><li>Horror</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Polish National Film Academy</li></ul><li>Nacionalities</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=38><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Roman Polanski Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/roman-polanski</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: March 2, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVoqailkaN6sbvLmqWso5k%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2froman-polanski.html&text=Roman%20Polanski%20-%20Sharon%20Tate%2c%20Movies%20%26amp%3b%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froman-polanski.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2froman-polanski.html&title=Roman%20Polanski%20-%20Sharon%20Tate%2c%20Movies%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2froman-polanski.html&title=Roman%20Polanski%20-%20Sharon%20Tate%2c%20Movies%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2froman-polanski.html&title=Roman%20Polanski%20-%20Sharon%20Tate%2c%20Movies%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froman-polanski.html&description=Roman%20Polanski%20-%20Sharon%20Tate%2c%20Movies%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sarah-shahi-ethnicity-details-on-the-actress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Shahi Ethnicity: Details On The Actress">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./marjorie-taylor-greenes-cruella-de-vil-ensemble-leaves-state-of-the-union-viewers-wondering-who-wore-it-better.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marjorie Taylor Greenes Cruella de Vil ensemble leaves State of the Union viewers wondering who w">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
