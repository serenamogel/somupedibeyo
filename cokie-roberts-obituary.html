Her mother Lindy Claiborne Boggs took his seat until the end of 1990.

She married fellow journalist Steve Roberts in 1966, who she met while in college at a political event. “I knew what an extraordinary person Cokie was,” he said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/fashion/weddings/cokie-and-steven-roberts-a-half-century-of-changing-together.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2017 interview with The New York Times" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">2017 interview with The New York Times</a>. “I was bowled over by her enormous intellect and that has been part of our lives throughout our relationship.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The official statement of the family reads: “Her values put family and relationships above all else. She is survived by her husband of 53 years, journalist, author and professor Steven V. Roberts, her children Lee Roberts and Rebecca Roberts, her grandchildren Regan, Hale and Cecilia Roberts and Claiborne, Jack and Roland Hartman, along with numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins. She is also survived by friendships and by causes that she put her time, resources and energy into that are too numerous to count.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmibn6C2pnnRqJmeqqSoerCuyK2smqqp</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcokie-roberts-obituary.html&text=Cokie%20Roberts%2c%20Political%20Journalist%20and%20Best-Selling%20Author%2c%20Dies%20at%2075&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcokie-roberts-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcokie-roberts-obituary.html&title=Cokie%20Roberts%2c%20Political%20Journalist%20and%20Best-Selling%20Author%2c%20Dies%20at%2075" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcokie-roberts-obituary.html&title=Cokie%20Roberts%2c%20Political%20Journalist%20and%20Best-Selling%20Author%2c%20Dies%20at%2075" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcokie-roberts-obituary.html&title=Cokie%20Roberts%2c%20Political%20Journalist%20and%20Best-Selling%20Author%2c%20Dies%20at%2075" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcokie-roberts-obituary.html&description=Cokie%20Roberts%2c%20Political%20Journalist%20and%20Best-Selling%20Author%2c%20Dies%20at%2075" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ben-grosskopf.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Grosskopf- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./albert-pujols-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Albert Pujols Net Worth : Career &amp;amp; Book">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
