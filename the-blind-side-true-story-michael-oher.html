Oher was already 6-foot-5-inches and 350 pounds, which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/BlindSide/blind-side-michael-oher-story/story?id=9390739" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="made him a prime recruit" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">made him a prime recruit</a> for drug dealers seeking some muscle. He was less of a desirable prospect for prestigious private schools, but when Tony took his son Steven to the local Briarcrest Christian School, Big Mike, as he was called, tagged along for the ride anyway.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He wasn’t no trouble kid, nothing like that, you know?” Henderson later <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/BlindSide/blind-side-michael-oher-story/story?id=9390739" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told ABC News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told ABC News</a>. “He was real quiet, you know, and just stayed to himself.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He was so quiet, in fact, that Briarcrest’s admissions team couldn’t really find a reason to admit him, let alone offer him a scholarship. Having spent his life just trying to survive, getting into an expensive private school wasn’t really on Oher’s radar. He barely spoke during interviews, his reading comprehension level was closer to elementary school, and tests showed he had an IQ that barely cracked 80.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perhaps, these facts led to the movie’s general portrayal of Oher, who is played by Quinton Aaron. It’s one of Oher’s biggest complaints, though he has complimented Aaron’s acting. “I felt like it portrayed me as dumb instead of as a kid who had never had consistent academic instruction and ended up thriving once he got it,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133590180/beyond-the-blind-side-michael-oher-rewrites-his-own-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oher wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Oher wrote</a> in I Beat the Odds.<br></p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Movies Based on Real Life</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, the Briarcrest football coach was interested in Oher, not just as a prospect for the team but as a redemption story. This was a kid who’d never been given half a chance, he told the school president and principal, making the case for a very large exception to their typical admissions process. The principal, Steve Simpson, felt stirrings of sympathy and issued Oher a challenge: If he could get his grades up in another private school, he could enter the far more prestigious Briarcrest the next semester.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Within a few months, Simpson had a change of heart and admitted Oher to his school. But entering Briarcrest was no panacea and produced no immediate change. The kid was out of place, shy, awkward, and way behind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This is where the movie and real life began to diverge. In reality, Oher couch-surfed at the homes of his fellow students and foster families for his first few years at school and played three sports—basketball, track and field, and football—before ever meeting the Tuohy clan in 2003. In the movie, Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is fully homeless and has nothing to do with athletics until the very wealthy and generous Tuohy family took him in.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Life with the Tuohys provided stability and family</h2><img alt="sandra bullock and leigh anne tuohy embrace while posing for a photo, both women wear white dresses and their hair down, bullock looks right of the camera and tuohy smiles directly at the camera" title="Sandra Bullock with Leigh Anne Tuohy at a ‘The Blind Side’ premiere, November 2009" width=3075 height=2181 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-93243522.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Sandra Bullock and Leigh Anne Tuohy attend a The Blind Side premiere event in November 2009.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock in the movie, is the outspoken matriarch of the family and wife of Sean Tuohy, played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/tim-mcgraw data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tim McGraw" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tim McGraw</a>, a former college basketball star and wealthy fast food entrepreneur. The movie posits that their young son S.J.’s mismatched schoolyard friendship with Oher is the catalyst for their involvement in his life, while in reality, it was actually Sean noticing Oher on the sidelines at the gym that prompted their involvement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon after Sean first met Oher, he set up a standing cafeteria account for him so that he’d be able to eat lunch every day. Eventually, on Thanksgiving weekend, the family crossed paths with Oher, who was walking alone in the rain, wearing his only pair of shorts and going nowhere in particular. They took him in for the weekend, an arrangement that soon became permanent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A tutor was hired.
